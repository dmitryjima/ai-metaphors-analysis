    "para_1": "In recent years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology has become a buzzword. With the rapid development of computational capabilities and the global spread of the Internet, a large set of innovations based mainly on Machine Learning and Big Data technologies have entered people’s everyday lives. From social media feeds and chat-bots to self-driving vehicles and literal rocket science, we see the adoption of self-learning algorithms that create an impression of intelligent machines becoming reality being just around the corner. Emerging technologies have always meant new opportunities and new challenges for humanity. The discussion around the AI’s usage, current state, and its future has expanded from the niche fields of computer science and sci-fi, and become part of the everyday agenda. With this new spur, AI and AI-related topics have entered all types of discourse - economical, political, mass-media, entertainment - causing both specialists and non-specialists to participate in the discussion, expressing their opinions and thoughts in a variety of ways. Political and media discourse, in this case, represents a field worth studying, as it highly affects and shapes not only the future of AI technology but the discussion around it, as well.",
    "para_2": "Artificial Intelligence has been compared to a “new space race”, claimed to be “more dangerous than nukes”, predicted to be a driving force for a new Industrial Revolution. We believe that the usage of analogical reasoning in the discussion around AI is not incidental. Previous studies of discourse around emerging technologies (such as the Internet) proved that metaphors and analogies play a large role in understanding and explaining the technology, as well as shaping public opinion and affecting the decision-making process in both political and business circles. Artificial Intelligence technology has great potential for studies from the perspective of Cognitive linguistics that is aimed at studying the correlations between language and thought processes. ",
    "para_3": "This project is an attempt to conduct a comparative study of metaphors that have emerged around the field of Artificial Intelligence, based on the media discourse of three countries that have demonstrated interest in the AI technologies: the Russian Federation, the People’s Republic of China, and the United States of America. The paper is aimed at moving forward the field of Cognitive studies around emerging technologies, proving that in all the cases under study, the metaphorization takes place, the used metaphors and their characteristics are influenced by each country’s specifics.",
